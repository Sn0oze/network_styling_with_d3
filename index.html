			    <b>This is a tool</b> for creating nice looking networks. You may find it useful if you, like me, feel that Gephi is too heavy-weight, networkx is too ugly and writing d3 code everytime you want to make a pretty network is too cumbersome.
			    <br><br>
			    <b>To start using it</b> open the controls menu (there â†‘) and start sliding things left and right. You can insert a link to your data or simply upload it, and once you are happy with how it looks you can download it.
			    <br><br>
			    <b>Data should be</b> either JSON or CSV, and there are some simple rules for formatting, but the easiest thing is just to mimic the formatting of these example files(<a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ulfaslak/6be66de1ac3288d5c1d9452570cbba5a/raw/4cab5036464800e51ce59fc088688e9821795efb/miserables.json">JSON</a>, <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ulfaslak/66a0baa60b6fe1a5e4cc0891b2b1017d/raw/1cba9e4fbf3d0cec7c6c4f0ff6ab3fb54609f2d3/miserables.csv">CSV</a>). Note that for CSV, the 'weight' column is optional and that by default node sizes are set to the node degrees.
			    <br><br>
			    <b>Most of the attributes</b> in the control panel are self-explanatory, but what's good to know is that the 'Physics' attributes relate to variables in the <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-force">d3-force</a> API, while the '... scaling exponent' attributes control <i>the power to which nodes sizes and link weights are raised</i> before rendering. For example, if 'node scaling exponent' is 0.5, the size of rendered nodes is the half power (which is the square root) of the 'size' attribute given by the input, such that node area is proportional to 'size' attribute. If 1, node radius is propotional with 'size'. If negative, nodes with a large 'size' attribute become small and vice versa. But for simplicity just think of the exponent as a parameter for tuning the "unevenness" of node sizes or link weights.
			    <br><br>
			    <b>Parameter presets</b> can be saved, exported and reset. This all happens in the top bar of the control panel. It's useful if you have a series of networks that you want to visualize with the same layout. What you can do then, is the style on until you like how it look and the click 'Save' and give that parameter preset a name. When you load a new network (or close the browser and come back) your browser will remember those values.
